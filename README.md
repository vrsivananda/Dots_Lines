## Intro
This is an experiment I am working on with Prof. Megan Peters (UCR).

My main contribution here is the lines-coherence plugin which can be found in [Dots_Lines/Dots_Lines/jspsych-6.0.5/plugins/jspsych-lines-coherence.js](https://github.com/vrsivananda/Dots_Lines/blob/master/Dots_Lines/jspsych-6.0.5/plugins/jspsych-lines-coherence.js)

This plugin allows researchers to test the line orientation perception of subjects by showing them patches of lines and then clicking on the one with the most coherent lines (in terms of %). This code is generalizable and researchers are able to create as many customized stimuli on the screen as they wish.
